How to run Ruby programs -

ruby rbfilename.

also can use irb

Irb is a repl.

Repl is a read-eval-print loop. It is good for texting.

Pry is another repl. A lot of bitmaker instructors love pry.

repls are common to programming languages. They are good to use as a playground and experiment.

Data types are the building blocks of ruby.

All data types are objects.

Numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, hashes, symbols, constants, classes.

Ruby is a dynamically typed language. Ruby figures out what type of data we re workng with (We dont have to define "this will be a string" or "this will be a number")

##Numbers - there are dif kinds
	Integers: FixNum, Bignum
	Float

	Intergers are whole numbers, can be positive or negative.
